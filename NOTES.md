### Tech Philosophy

- play around, be curious, then figure out what you want to do 
- maybe tell a lil' rubber ducky your plans
- make it work, make it fast, make it pretty
- try to get the deepest understanding you can **without** giving the ol' yak a buzzcut
- consider how easy your code will be to modify, test, and control as a *human*
- what features do you need for an MVP? what features would be nice to have? what features are dreams made of?
- who is the end audience for the code? is it pretty easy to read?

## Wat me do?

### Applicable Artistic Works

#### Reference Material

- [Flyby (Lecture) on Music Theory and Data Structures Cheatsheet](https://github.com/arntzy/music_theory_flyby/blob/master/music_theory_cheatsheet.txt)

#### Process Works

- [Buckminster Fuller](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0EYjeHC8J8YZzVCMElSQ1EtT1U/view?usp=sharing)
  - art song with scientific text
- Edenfred Artist Residency (RIP)
  - [Knot Abstract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0EYjeHC8J8YamF6NHd6MXpBdmc/view?usp=sharing)
  - [Deep Fritz vs. Vladimir Kramnik](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0EYjeHC8J8YWFhjU1poS3hLbGc/view?usp=sharing) (should I play some of this?)
  - [A Drunkards Walk from C Major](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0EYjeHC8J8YOGJjVFpSUG1nbjQ/view?usp=sharing)
    - Used a mathematical concept of a [drunkard's walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) to generate the source materials
    - Assembly version of Drunkards - (prepare a playlist in cmus)
- [Deep Piano Op. 1](https://medium.com/dbrs-innovation-labs/in-his-novel-galatea-2-2-e9d11c9b7c2a)
  - char-RNN using Lilypond files to generate 'new' piano scores.
  - Play the recordings from LPR?

#### ITP Thesis

- [Sonivim](https://vimeo.com/127210771)
  - sonfication of keystrokes in the vim text editor
- [TuRING](https://vimeo.com/127219302)
  - change the 'piano' under your fingertips according to the 'movement' of a [turing tape]() calculation.


## Examples?

### p5

#### play-scale

- simple synthesis concepts
- waveform, envelope, midi notes 

#### play-audio

- show loading of a sample 

#### cat-sampler

- To generate material from inside the `scripts/` directory (might not always work, haha!):
```bash
$ ./getVideos.sh -c 6 -s <searchTerm>`
$ ./assetList.sh
```
- Serve p5 and press keys! 

### TidalCycles
  - [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome)

#### chords
  
-  demonstrate randomness of theory

#### trumbone
 
- randomness with samples

#### string quartet

- more randomness with samples

## GO OUT THERE AND MAKE SOMETHING!
